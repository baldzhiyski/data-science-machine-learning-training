## Remaining Tasks Overview

- **Model evaluation**  
  Try new feature sets and evaluate different clustering algorithms to improve performance.

- **Cleaning and preprocessing**  
  Clean the notebooks and split them into different sections for better readability.


- ** Optimize paths and imports**

- **Hyperparameter tuning**  
  Optimize the hypertuning and change the models to the new ones

- **Feature engineering**  
  Refine, scale, transform, or reduce features to enhance clustering performance.

- **Try different cluster numbers**  
  Evaluate multiple values for the number of clusters to find the most meaningful data partitioning.

- **Visualizations of clusters**  
  Create clear visual representations (e.g., PCA, t-SNE plots) to interpret and explain clustering results.

- **Documentation and reporting**
   Create a full documentation of methods, results, and insights gained from the clustering analysis.
