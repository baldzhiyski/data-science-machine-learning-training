## Remaining Tasks Overview

- **Test different base models**  
  Experiment with multiple clustering algorithms to compare their behavior and performance on the dataset.

- **Hyperparameter tuning**  
  Optimize key model parameters to improve cluster quality and stability.

- **Feature engineering**  
  Refine, scale, transform, or reduce features to enhance clustering performance.

- **Try different cluster numbers**  
  Evaluate multiple values for the number of clusters to find the most meaningful data partitioning.

- **Visualizations of clusters**  
  Create clear visual representations (e.g., PCA, t-SNE plots) to interpret and explain clustering results.

- **Model evaluation**  
  Assess clustering quality using appropriate metrics and compare results across models and configurations.

- **Documentation and reporting**
   Create a full documentation of methods, results, and insights gained from the clustering analysis.
